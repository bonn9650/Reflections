When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all 
your work local?

When collaborating with another developer or when working from multiple
computers, or to ensure that there is a backup of your files accessable
from anywhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If someone else commits changes to a file you are also working on it
could create merge issues.
