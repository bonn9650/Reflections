What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do 
it?

When you initialize a repository, Git creates a hiddin .git file in the
specified directory which contains the metadata for the repository and 
is the master file.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to organize the content of a single commit
accross multiple files. This serves as a prep and organizational tool
to make sure that each commit is logical and contains the appropriate 
files before moving on.
